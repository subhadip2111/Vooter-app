 **Why I Chose This Tech Stack**:
React and Redux: React is a popular and widely adopted library for building modern user interfaces. Redux provides a predictable state management system that works seamlessly with React, making it easier to manage complex application states.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development of custom designs without writing extensive CSS styles. Its utility-first approach aligns with the project's goal of maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

Node.js and Express.js: Node.js is an excellent choice for building the server-side of the application, offering scalability and high performance. Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, simplifies routing and middleware management.

JavaScript: As a full-stack JavaScript developer, using JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end streamlines the development process and allows for code reuse.

MongoDB: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, provides flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for handling various types of data. Its document-oriented nature aligns well with the project's data requirements.
